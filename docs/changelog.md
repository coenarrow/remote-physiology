# Changelog

This file tracks development milestones. As of 2026-08-25 all branches (HPC, MacOS, phys-hydra) are unified into `main`, which has intentionally diverged from upstream rPPG-Toolbox (upstream fixes are cherry-picked only).

**Format:** Each entry records the date, the branch or development context, and a summary of changes. Entries are listed in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

## 2026-08-31 — Branch: `main` — Overhaul Phases 1–3

Executed per `docs/plans/2026-08-31-overhaul-roadmap.md`:

- **Phase 1**: repo renamed **remote-physiology**; root scratch, upstream
  weights (`final_model_release/`), `figures/` and stale docs deleted;
  `.slurm_scripts/` tracked as reference material; last legacy state tagged
  `pre-overhaul`.
- **Phase 2**: zarr cache contract documented dataset-agnostically in
  `docs/architecture.md`; the twelve legacy per-dataset loaders distilled into
  markdown cache specs (`dataset/data_loader/<NAME>.md`) and deleted along
  with `BaseLoader`, face detection and the `.npy`-cache tools (~39K lines);
  `neckflix_main.py` promoted to the single entry point `main.py`; the
  unsupervised predictor's legacy tuple path removed.
- **Phase 3**: attribute filtering generalized — the hardcoded
  `NECKFLIX.{POSTURES,PERSPECTIVES,LIGHT,SESSIONS}` keys replaced by one
  `NECKFLIX.FILTERS` node keyed by whatever root attrs a store carries
  (`FILTERS: {posture: ['0','45'], light: ['D']}`); `PARTICIPANTS`/CLI stay
  the separate, id-normalising LOSO surface. `BaseZarrDataset` was already
  attribute-generic; a new dataset is now a `channel_map` subclass plus a
  markdown cache spec, with no filter plumbing.

## 2026-08-31 — Branch: `main`

Carried the Neckflix loader's dicts through the whole pipeline; got all seven
unsupervised methods and PhysMamba running on the zarr cache.

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-31-neckflix-dict-contract-design.md`.

### The contract
- `neural_methods/batch.py`: the batch-dict key names and the two einops shape
  moves (`stack_frames`, `split_signals`) plus their inverses and traversal
  helpers. A model now returns *the input dict plus* `predictions`, so frames,
  labels, stats, masks, metadata and predictions travel together, each
  identifiable by key.
- `neural_methods/model/DictModel.py`: base class owning channel/trace order and
  the frame transform. Subclasses implement only
  `forward_video(video) -> (B, S, T)`. A plain tensor in still gets a plain
  tensor out, so the upstream tuple-contract trainers are unaffected.
- `neural_methods/frame_transforms.py`: `DATA_TYPE`
  (Raw/Standardized/DiffNormalized, concatenated along channels) and spatial
  resize moved consumer-side, since the zarr loader emits raw pixels.
- Every reshape in new or touched code is einops.

### Models and training
- `PhysMamba` is a `DictModel`: configurable input channels and output signals,
  `AdaptiveAvgPool3d((None, 1, 1))` so one model serves any `CHUNK_LENGTH`,
  einops throughout. Architecture unchanged.
- `SignalDictWrapper` rebuilt as a `DictModel` adapter (`frames2d` / `video3d`),
  which is how DeepPhys joins the contract untouched.
- `neural_methods/trainer/MultiSignalTrainer.py`: one trainer for every
  dict-contract model, driven by `MODEL_REGISTRY` (PhysMamba, DeepPhys). Masked
  multi-signal loss, DDP, AMP, signal-keyed saved outputs, and per-signal
  metrics reported in both normalised and **physical** units (mmHg for ABP/CVP,
  via each window's own `label_stats` and the exact inverse of its
  normalisation).
- `mamba_compat.MambaRef`: pure-PyTorch selective-SSM block used where
  `mamba_ssm` has no wheel (Windows), so PhysMamba is runnable and testable
  everywhere. Fused CUDA path untouched where the package exists; warns once
  about the memory cost of materialising the hidden state.

### Wiring
- `neckflix_main.py` rebuilt around the zarr loader: LOSO by participant filter,
  optional DDP, `--valid_participants`, `--limit_windows` for smoke runs, and a
  refusal when `USE_LAST_EPOCH: False` has no validation split to select on
  (which would otherwise silently test epoch 0).
- `dataset/data_loader/neckflix_config.py`: yacs -> loader plain-dict
  translation, including `P015` -> `"015"`.
- `config.py`: `CHUNK_STRIDE`, `TRAIN.LOSS`, and `NECKFLIX.{LABEL_NORM,
  ALLOW_MISSING, MIN_CHANNELS, MIN_LABELS, PERSPECTIVES, LIGHT, SESSIONS,
  PARTICIPANTS}`, added uniformly to all four data blocks.
- Configs: `configs/neckflix/NECKFLIX_UNSUPERVISED.yaml`,
  `NECKFLIX_PHYSMAMBA.yaml`, `NECKFLIX_PHYSMAMBA_SMOKE.yaml`.
- `tools/list_neckflix_folds.py` enumerates LOSO folds (metadata-only, login-node
  safe); `tools/summarise_neckflix_outputs.py` turns a saved test pickle into a
  per-window table and per-signal summary offline (replacing the broken
  `neckflix_metrics.py` scratch file's job); SLURM scripts for the unsupervised
  sweep, a LOSO array, and a 4-GPU fold.

### Unsupervised methods — three were hard-broken by NumPy 2
- **POS** and **ICA** used `np.mat`, removed in NumPy 2.0. Rewritten on plain
  ndarrays with einops reshapes; pinned in tests against frozen pre-NumPy-2
  originals (`tests/reference/`) to 1e-10 / 1e-8.
- **PBV** relied on `linalg.solve` treating a 2-D right-hand side as a stack of
  vectors, which NumPy 2.0 changed to a matrix solve. Fixed with an explicit
  trailing axis.
- POS's per-frame overlap-add is now a strided sliding window (~960x faster);
  GREEN/LGI/OMIT/CHROM reshapes moved to einops.
- `unsupervised_predict` accepts both dataset contracts and, for Neckflix,
  scores each window against **every** trace the recording carries (ABP/CVP/ECG),
  honouring `label_mask`. `unsupervised_predict_many` runs all seven methods in
  one pass over the data.
- `evaluation/metrics_report.py` extracted so both predictors share the metric
  aggregation.
- A fourth `np.mat` break sat outside `unsupervised_methods/`:
  `BaseLoader.generate_pos_psuedo_labels` and its verbatim twin in
  `BP4DPlusBigSmallLoader` each carried an inline copy of POS, so
  `USE_PSUEDO_PPG_LABEL: True` was broken for every dataset. Both now call the
  shared `POS_WANG.pos_signal`, pinned to the original to 1e-10.

### Shared post-processing (exact-equivalent, much faster)
- `_detrend`: the smoothness-priors detrend built a dense n x n matrix and
  inverted it. `I + lambda^2 D'D` is symmetric pentadiagonal, so it is now a
  banded Cholesky solve — O(n) instead of O(n^3), 0.75 s -> 0.09 ms at n=300,
  matching the dense form to 5e-11. Benefits every dataset.
- `_compute_macc`: the per-lag `corrcoef` loop is one circular cross-correlation;
  by FFT it is bit-identical and ~350x faster.

### Robustness fixes surfaced by running it
- Bland-Altman plots survive degenerate data (`gaussian_kde` raises on a
  singular covariance; density colouring now degrades to a constant).
- The HR report says *why* Pearson is undefined instead of printing
  `nan +/- nan`.
- `MultiSignalTrainer` indexes its GPU by `LOCAL_RANK`, not the global rank
  (multi-node correctness), and honours `DEVICE: cpu`; `neckflix_main` picks the
  DDP backend from where the model will actually live.

### mamba-ssm now builds on Windows (native, no WSL)
Three independent blockers, all confirmed rather than guessed:
- **No Windows wheel exists.** PyPI carries an sdist only; the GitHub release
  assets are `linux_x86_64` / `linux_aarch64`. Windows must compile
  `selective_scan_cuda` itself.
- **`triton` is unsatisfiable on Windows** — wheels-only on PyPI, zero Windows
  files, no sdist — and `selective_scan_interface` imports it unguarded. This
  bites before any compiler runs: uv resolves, then refuses to install anything.
  Fixed with `triton-windows` (the same 3.2 series torch 2.6 pairs with, which
  imports as `triton`) plus `override-dependencies` confining `triton` to Linux.
- **The CUDA sources do not compile with MSVC.** `#ifndef USE_ROCM` sits inside a
  `BOOL_SWITCH(...)` macro argument (UB; GCC accepts it, MSVC/EDG says `"#" not
  expected here`); `M_LOG2E` needs `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`; and `BOOL_SWITCH` passes
  an enclosing `constexpr` as a template argument from inside a lambda, which
  needs `/Zc:lambda` (`error C2975`).

`vendor/mamba-ssm` is upstream 2.3.1 with those three fixes, regenerated and
verifiable by `tools/vendor_mamba_windows.py` (`--check`). `pyproject.toml`
points `mamba-ssm` there **only** under `sys_platform == 'win32'`; the lock keeps
separate entries for linux-x86_64 (PyPI 2.3.1) and aarch64 (2.3.2.post1), so HPC
resolution is unchanged. `causal-conv1d` needed no patch, only the marker
widened. `uv sync` builds both in ~21 min and caches the result.

Verified against a Quadro RTX 5000 (sm_75), CUDA 12.4, MSVC 14.44:
- Kernel correctness: `selective_scan_cuda` vs `selective_scan_ref`, forward
  2.8e-05 on a signal of scale 168, worst gradient 3.0e-04 — fp32
  accumulation-order noise.
- PhysMamba at the production 128x128x128: **229 ms/step and 1.38 GiB**, against
  1959 ms and 5.13 GiB for the `MambaRef` fallback — 8.6x faster, 3.7x smaller.

### A latent bug this exposed
Installing `mamba-ssm` made PhysMamba and PhysHydra unrunnable on CPU — the
fused kernels raise `Expected x.is_cuda() to be true` — so 24 CPU tests failed
on exactly the machines that have the fast path. That was already true of the
HPC; Windows had been passing only because `MambaRef` stood in.
`mamba_compat.PortableMamba` subclasses `Mamba` and runs the reference math over
*the same module's own weights* off CUDA. The parameter sets are provably
identical (strict `load_state_dict` both ways), so there is one checkpoint and
one parameter set, and the two paths agree to 1e-07 in output and 4e-06 in
gradients.

### Verified
- 241 tests pass, none skipped, with `mamba_ssm` installed — the parallel-scan
  test that used to skip for want of the package now runs against it. Included
  is a regression test that drives the real `PhysMambaTrainer` over the upstream
  tuple contract, since PhysMamba and the post-processing both changed
  under the non-Neckflix datasets.
- All seven unsupervised methods over 1243 real windows (44 participants), the
  whole sweep in ~4 minutes on CPU. Best HR agreement against the ABP reference:
  CHROM (MAE 3.83 bpm, Pearson 0.64), POS (4.12, 0.62), ICA (5.79, 0.48);
  GREEN and PBV worst (~9.4). CVP and ECG references agree far less well, as
  expected — ABP is a pressure pulse, whereas an FFT "HR" from CVP or from
  bandpassed ECG is unreliable. The per-signal table says so rather than
  averaging them together.
- PhysMamba trains and tests end to end on the real cache predicting ABP + CVP +
  ECG together, on CPU at 32x32 and on GPU at the production 128x128x128. A
  small learning check (8 epochs, 600 windows at 72x72, P015 held out) takes the
  loss from ~0.99 to ~0.40 and reaches ABP waveform Pearson 0.76 / MACC 0.87 /
  HR MAE 8.7 bpm on the unseen subject -- untuned, but well clear of chance, and
  ordered ABP > CVP > ECG exactly as the unsupervised baselines suggest.

## 2026-08-25 — Branch: `main`

Unified branches, wired local Neckflix subset, replaced the vendored mamba fork.

### Changes
- Merged HPC and MacOS branches; absorbed phys-hydra history; deleted all branches except `main`
- Reduced drift vs upstream; upstream/main fully merged at b7500b8 (intentional divergence begins here)
- Added local physhydra configs targeting the Neckflix subset cache (P030-P039)
- Added `mamba-ssm-macos` (darwin) and newest official `mamba-ssm` + `causal-conv1d` (linux) as platform-marked deps
- **Removed vendored `tools/mamba` fork.** PhysMamba/PhysHydra now use vanilla mamba_ssm via `neural_methods/model/mamba_compat.py`: `make_mamba(..., bimamba=True)` returns a composition-based `BiMamba` (two vanilla blocks, one time-reversed, summed). NOT parameter-compatible with fork-trained checkpoints; fresh training required. Separate in/out projections per direction (small param increase vs fork's shared projections)
- MPS support: trainers select cuda -> mps -> cpu; parallel (Hillis-Steele) selective scan with analytical-backward autograd for non-CUDA mamba_ssm (~340x faster than CPU loop at debug res; full 128x128 res trains at ~19 s/step, 18 GB on M1 Pro)
- Added tests/test_mamba_compat.py (BiMamba semantics + parallel-scan-vs-reference)
