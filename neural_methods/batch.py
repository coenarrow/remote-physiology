"""The Neckflix batch dict: key names and the einops moves in and out of it.

The zarr loader emits nested dicts keyed by canonical channel and signal names
(the contract is documented in ``docs/architecture.md``), and
those dicts travel unchanged through models, losses and evaluation. This module
is the single place that knows the key names and the exactly two shape moves the
contract needs: packing ``frames`` into a backbone tensor, and splitting a
backbone tensor back into per-signal predictions.

Per-sample (dataset ``__getitem__``)::

    {"frames":       {ch:  (1, T, H, W) float32},   # raw pixel values
     "labels":       {sig: (T,)         float32},   # per-window normalised
     "label_stats":  {sig: {stat: ()    float32}},  # physical units
     "channel_mask": {ch:  ()           bool},
     "label_mask":   {sig: ()           bool},
     "metadata":     {"recording_id": str, "camera_id": str, "start_frame": int}}

Collated (``default_collate``) every tensor gains a leading batch axis, and the
metadata strings become lists. A model adds ``PREDICTIONS`` -> ``{sig: (B, T)}``
and returns the whole dict, so any tensor anywhere in the pipeline is
identifiable by its key.
