"""The per-signal composite loss for the multi-signal batch-dict contract.

Two things vary per signal, and they vary together (migration contract §3):

* an **absolute-class** signal (ABP, CVP) arrives in physical units and its
  *level* is part of the prediction, so it is scored with CCC plus L1 terms on
  the window mean and on the soft systolic/diastolic peaks — all in mmHg;
* a **shape-class** signal (PPG, ECG, RESP) arrives per-window z-scored and
  only its waveform means anything, so it is scored with negpearson.

So the loss is stated per trace, outright: which components, at what weight
(``INTERFACE.LOSS``, ``{ABP: {CCC: 1.0, MEAN: 0.05, ...}}``). There are no
presets and no class-implied defaults — the weights *are* the loss. That is
also where the per-signal scale factors live — raw ABP error is O(10 mmHg),
CVP O(1 mmHg), and a CCC term is O(1) in any units, so an unweighted sum would
let ABP own every gradient. There are deliberately no global or dataset-wide
normalisation constants: the model predicts physical units off an
activation-free readout, and the weights are the one place the units are
reconciled.

Every component reduces **per sample** to ``(B,)``, which is what lets the
masking compose: each is averaged over the batch with the denominator clamped
to >= 1, so a signal no window in the batch carries contributes exactly 0 —
never NaN, never a sentinel.

Contract splits the two halves: this module produces the *unweighted*
components (a model calls it inside its own forward, and the values ride the
batch as ``raw_losses``), and :func:`weight_losses` applies the config weights
and reduces them to the scalar to backpropagate — the mean over modules, as it
has always been over traces. Keeping them apart is what lets a run plot a
component's raw magnitude against its weighted contribution, which is how a
drowned or dominating term is spotted.

The statistics are derived from the predicted waveform itself (soft local
extrema + a temperature softmax, after ``PhysHydraLoss``), not from a second
head, so a waveform can never disagree with its own systolic and diastolic
values.
