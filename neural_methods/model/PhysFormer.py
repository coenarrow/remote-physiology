"""PhysFormer: temporal-difference transformer for physiological measurement.

Yu et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12082 — a combination of ``Physformer.py``
and ``transformer_layer.py`` from the official implementation
(https://github.com/ZitongYu/PhysFormer).

The architecture is unchanged from the original. One thing differs from the
published network: the first layer (``Stem0``'s conv) takes ``in_channels``
inputs (the interface's channel count) instead of 3. The readout
(``ConvBlockLast``) stays a single plane, a bare ``Conv1d`` with no
activation, so an absolute-class signal like ABP can be predicted directly in
mmHg; a multi-signal run is one complete copy of this network per trace
(``MultiTraceModel``), never a widened readout on a shared trunk. The loss is
the trainer's, not the original's, and is whatever the interface's ``LOSS``
block states; the published DLDL frequency/KL term is not carried yet, which
``configs/interfaces/physformer_interface.yaml`` notes beside its negative
Pearson.

Everything between those two layers — the 3-D stem, the (4,4,4) tube
tokenization, the three temporal-difference transformer stages, the temporal
upsampling head — is the published network, and on
``configs/interfaces/physformer_interface.yaml`` (128x128 frames, 160-frame
windows) the forward pass is numerically the published one.

Any other frame size or window length is accepted through two adaptive
stages around that network, both exact no-ops at the paper's shape:

* the original wrote the token grid as ``view(B, C, P//16, 4, 4)``, true only
  for 128x128 frames. Here the stem's output is average-pooled to the nearest
  multiple of the 4-pixel patch and the grid is read off the result: 128x128
  frames still tokenize to the paper's 4x4 (a pool from 16x16 to 16x16 is the
  identity, bin for bin), 72x72 frames to 2x2, and so on down to 8x8 frames,
  the smallest the stem's three 2x pools leave anything of;
* the 4-frame tubes and the head's two 2x temporal upsamples need a window
  that divides by 4. The stem's output is average-pooled in time to the
  nearest multiple of 4 and the prediction is linearly interpolated back to
  the window length; when the window already divides by 4 neither runs.

No parameter is added, renamed or resized, so the upstream checkpoint loads
strictly. A clip backbone on the multi-signal contract: ``(B, C_in, T, H, W)``
raw frames in, ``(B, 1, T)`` out, the loss owned by the trainer. The input
preprocessing is the network's own first stage: the raw clip is
difference-normalised (``DiffNormalize``, the toolbox's DiffNormalized block,
with the clip's own statistics) before the stem, which is what the published
network was fed. All reshaping is einops.
