"""PhysNet: an end-to-end spatio-temporal encoder-decoder for rPPG.

Yu et al., "Remote Photoplethysmograph Signal Measurement from Facial Videos
Using Spatio-Temporal Networks", BMVC 2019.

The architecture is unchanged from the original: the same 3D-conv stem, the
same encoder-decoder trunk that halves time twice and doubles it back twice
via transposed convolutions, the same single-plane readout. One thing differs
from the published network: the stem takes ``in_channels`` inputs (the
interface's channel count) instead of 3. The readout stays a single output
plane; a multi-signal run is one complete copy of this network per trace
(``MultiTraceModel``), never a widened readout on a shared trunk. At ``3``
this is exactly the original, layer for layer.

Any window length is accepted: the trunk halves time twice before the
transposed convolutions double it back twice, so the stem's output is
average-pooled in time to the nearest multiple of 4 and the prediction is
linearly interpolated back to the window length after it. Both are skipped
when the window already divides by 4, so on
``configs/interfaces/physnet_interface.yaml`` (128-frame windows) the forward
pass is the published one. Frames may be any size from 16x16, the smallest
the four 2x spatial pools leave anything of.

A clip backbone on the multi-signal contract: ``(B, C_in, T, H, W)`` raw
frames in, ``(B, 1, T)`` out, the loss owned by the trainer. The input
preprocessing is the network's own first stage: the raw clip is
difference-normalised (``DiffNormalize``, the toolbox's DiffNormalized block,
with the clip's own statistics) before the stem, which is what the published
network was fed. All reshaping is einops.
