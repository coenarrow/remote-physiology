"""Heart rate from every cardiac trace, and from all of them fused.

Per recording, for every trace the registry marks cardiac (PPG, ECG, ABP,
CVP) that the recording labels, the estimate the upstream toolbox made: detrend,
bandpass to the heart-rate band, periodogram, the largest in-band bin, in
beats per minute. Run on the label and on the prediction, so every trace
reports its own reference and predicted rate and is compared with itself.
Two more *sources* join the per-trace ones whenever a recording carries at
least two cardiac traces:

``FUSED``
    The traces' power spectra, each normalised to unit power in the band,
    combined as their geometric mean — a product of spectra, so the
    frequency the traces agree on wins and a peak only one of them has
    (CVP's respiratory harmonic, say) is suppressed. Power spectra rather
    than complex ones: the traces are phase-shifted against each other by
    transit time and morphology, and a complex sum would cancel at the very
    fundamental it is after. Nothing goes back to a waveform, because a rate
    needs no phase. The prediction side fuses exactly the traces the label
    side has, so the fused prediction is compared with a fused label built
    the same way.

``MEDIAN``
    The median of the per-trace rates: the cheap baseline the fusion has to
    beat.

No config. The band and the detrender are the upstream ones; the label
modes are ``raw`` / ``zscore`` / ``minmax`` and the trace tables are already in
physical units, so nothing here needs to know how a trace was preprocessed.
The three upstream helpers this needs (the smoothness-prior detrender, the
FFT length and the maximum amplitude of cross-correlation) live at the top
of this module; the rest of the toolbox's post-processing is gone.
