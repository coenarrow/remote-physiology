"""The signal registry, the cache vocabularies, and the label normalisation.

One module for everything that is *about a signal*: its canonical name and
aliases, which camera channels and cache groups exist, what class a signal
belongs to and what that implies, and how a window of its label is
normalised for the model and mapped back to physical units afterwards.

**Registry.** ``SIGNALS`` is the table; the accessors below read one column
of it for a canonical name. Two classes are distinguished: an ``absolute``
signal (ABP, CVP, SpO2) carries meaning in its physical units, so it is fed to
the model raw and scored on level as well as shape; a ``shape`` signal (PPG,
ECG, respiration) is per-window normalised and only its waveform matters.

**Label normalisation.** Every mode in ``LABEL_TRANSFORMS`` shares one
signature — ``(trace, stats) -> trace`` — and an exact inverse, both keyed
by the mode's name in the interface's ``LABEL_PREPROCESSING``. The dataset
computes ``finite_stats`` of the window once, normalises with them, and
stamps them into the batch as ``label_stats`` in physical units; the trainer
inverts predictions and labels with the same stats, so the round trip is
exact. The stats broadcast against a per-sample ``(T,)`` trace and a
collated ``(B, T)`` batch alike.
