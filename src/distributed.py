"""Where a run executes: which device, how many processes, and what to do
when the machine cannot give what the recipe asked for.

The recipe asks for a precision; the launcher says whether a GPU may be
used (``--no-gpu`` says not) and may ask for several processes. This module
resolves those against the machine and returns one :class:`Runtime`. Every
downgrade is a warning, never silence:

* launched under ``torch.distributed.run`` but distributed training cannot
  work here (no backend, fewer GPUs than ranks, no accelerator at all, Apple
  MPS) -> rank 0 carries on as a single process, every other rank exits;
* a GPU wanted but neither CUDA nor MPS present -> CPU, and a non-float32
  precision drops to float32 with it; ``--no-gpu`` with a non-float32
  precision drops it the same way;
* CUDA without NCCL (Windows) -> the Gloo backend, which works but is slower.

Single-process runs never touch ``torch.distributed`` at all.
